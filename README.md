## A Community-Based Recipe Sharing Platform

We have developed a recipe app called "food.folio" using the Flutter framework. The app allows users to browse, search, upload, and update recipes. We have integrated Firebase FireStore for storing recipe data and Firebase Authentication for user registration and login. 

The app’s homepage screen displays a list of recipes. When the user selects a recipe from the list, it will be directed to details of the recipe. The recipe’s detailed information page includes the photo, ingredients and cooking instructions. 

Additionally, the app provides users with the functionality to add or create their own recipes. They can input the recipe name, the path to the recipe image, description of the ingredients, and detailed instructions on how to cook the recipe.
